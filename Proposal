# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

## For our final project, we want to make a Minecraft Mod that offers more options for cooking. It would offer more food choices and 
## potential cooking options. Then, as a player, you can make actual meals and snacks. We plan to add more features as time progresses, 
## such as drink options, health affects, and possible negative affects (diseases). 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

## Kayla Toner

## Do you have any questions of your own?

## About how many features should we add to manage complexity? We planned to add food features then add more complexity from there.
